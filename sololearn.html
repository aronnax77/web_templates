        <p>The shapes on this page are not images.  They are created using css
           only.  Perhaps the most surprising of these shapes are the triangles
           which are shown at the end of the display.  Once the basic ideas
           regarding these shapes is understood it is possible to use them for
           a number of purposes including the simple animations shown in the
           title bar, buttons and decorations.  With imagination it is possible
           to make composite shapes into and all manner of images.</p>

        <p>This particular page was inspired by an article written

           other related ariticles in his blog pages DWB.
